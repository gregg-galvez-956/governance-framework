# Module 3 – Governance Failure and Enforcement

## 3.1 Enforcement Standing

### Purpose  
This section defines who has the authority to initiate governance review and enforcement processes. It ensures that challenges to governance are legitimate, structured, and mission-aligned while preventing misuse, harassment, or personality-driven conflict.

Enforcement standing protects the organization from both abuse of power and destabilizing attempts to weaponize governance procedures.

---

### 3.1.1 Categories of Standing  

The following entities may initiate governance review under this Module:

- Sustaining Members in good standing who do not currently serve on the Board  
- Founders or Founding Trustees (subject to sunset provisions)  
- Automatic enforcement triggers defined within this governance framework  

No other individual or group may initiate governance enforcement under this Module.

---

### 3.1.2 Sustaining Member Standing  

Sustaining Members may initiate governance review through the Governance Breach Petition process if they meet all eligibility criteria.

Eligibility requires:

- Current dues or financial support status, as reflected in the official membership ledger  
- Minimum three (3) consecutive months of sustaining membership  
- No current active suspension or restriction of membership rights  

Sustaining Member standing applies only to alleged violations of governing documents and may not be used to address operational disagreements, personal disputes, or non-governance matters.

**Verification safeguard:**  
If sustaining status is disputed or cannot be verified due to alleged misconduct, record unavailability, or conflict of interest, verification shall proceed through an alternate method defined in this Module (including automatic trigger to independent review procedures where appropriate). Standing may not be defeated solely by refusal, delay, or unilateral denial by an accused party.

---

### 3.1.3 Scope of Member Standing  

Member-initiated enforcement may address:

- Violations of bylaws, governance modules, or formally adopted policy  
- Failure to conduct required reviews  
- Abuse or expansion of emergency authority  
- Structural or mission-related governance breaches  
- Board inactivity or refusal to act on mandatory governance duties  

Member standing does not extend to:

- Routine operational decisions  
- Day-to-day staff or volunteer management  
- Informal disputes unrelated to governance authority or compliance  

---

### 3.1.4 Safeguards Against Misuse  

Enforcement procedures must not be used:

- As a harassment, intimidation, or retaliation tool  
- For repeated or bad-faith challenges  
- To obstruct routine governance without credible governance basis  

Petitions lacking specific allegations, governing-document citations, or credible supporting information may be dismissed with written explanation.

Repeated abusive or frivolous filings may result in review of the filer’s standing under the safeguards defined in this Module.

---

### 3.1.5 Founders and Founding Trustees  

Founders or designated Founding Trustees may initiate governance enforcement when:

- Structural or mission integrity is credibly at risk  
- The Board refuses or fails to act on mandatory governance duties  
- Membership enforcement mechanisms are compromised or unavailable  

Founding Trustees, if used, are defined as designated continuity stewards whose authority is limited to initiating enforcement processes, not exercising ongoing governance power.

---

### 3.1.6 Founder Standing and Sunset  

Founder or Founding Trustee enforcement standing exists as a stabilization safeguard and is temporary.

Founder enforcement standing shall sunset automatically after:

- Three completed Board rotations, and  
- A minimum of thirty-six (36) months from incorporation,  
whichever occurs later.

After sunset, founders retain no special enforcement standing beyond that of any sustaining member.

---

### 3.1.7 Automatic Enforcement Triggers  

Certain failures activate governance enforcement without petition, including:

- Failure to conduct mandatory review of an emergency action  
- Failure to meet quorum for required governance functions  
- Repeated procedural violations that undermine legitimacy  
- Refusal to schedule or conduct required governance processes  

These triggers activate further procedures defined in this Module and may bypass accused-party control.

---

### 3.1.8 Phase I and Phase II Governance Stability  

During the Stabilization Period defined in this framework:

- Member petition thresholds may be lower  
- Oversight safeguards are stronger  
- Review timelines may be shorter  

Following transition to Mature Governance:

- Petition thresholds may increase  
- Enforcement procedures emphasize institutional stability while maintaining legitimacy safeguards  

The transition occurs automatically and requires no Board vote.

---

### Structural Principle  

Legitimate enforcement protects both mission and stability.  
Authority to challenge power must be accessible, structured, and resistant to manipulation.
