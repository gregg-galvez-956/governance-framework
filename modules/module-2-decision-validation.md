# Module 2 – Governance Decision Validation Protocol

## 2.1 Authority Classification

### Purpose  
This section defines and structurally separates categories of authority within the Club to prevent role confusion, informal hierarchy, and unauthorized governance expansion. Authority is role-bound, documented, and limited. No authority expands through precedent, presence, habit, or personality.

---

## 2.1.1 Operational Authority

### Definition  
Operational Authority is the limited authority granted to individuals assigned to oversee the physical premises, meetings, and day-to-day functioning of the Club during designated hours.

### Scope  
Operational Authority may include:
- Maintaining order and safety on premises  
- Enforcing the Standards of Conduct  
- Issuing temporary protective actions as defined in Emergency Authority provisions  
- Managing facility access during assigned shifts  
- Preserving property and preventing immediate harm  

### Limitations  
Operational Authority may not:
- Amend policy  
- Modify mission language  
- Issue long-term bans  
- Create new rules  
- Override documented governance decisions  
- Exercise governance authority by presence, seniority, or perceived status  

Operational Authority is temporary, scoped, and role-bound.

---

## 2.1.2 Governance Authority

### Definition  
Governance Authority is the authority vested in the Board as a collective body to make binding decisions concerning policy, structure, discipline, and mission-related matters.

### Scope  
Governance Authority may only be exercised:
- Through properly noticed meetings  
- With quorum present (as defined in the bylaws)  
- By recorded vote  
- Under explicitly cited bylaw authority  

### Regular Meeting Notice  
Regular Board meetings must be noticed at least **seven (7) calendar days** in advance. Notice must be delivered through all officially designated communication channels maintained by the Board.

### Emergency Meetings  
Emergency Board meetings may be called with a minimum of **forty-eight (48) hours’ notice**.

Emergency meeting notice must:
- Clearly state the emergency issue  
- Explain why delay would materially risk safety, property, or mission integrity  

Emergency meetings:
- May address only the stated emergency matter  
- May not introduce unrelated business  
- May not amend mission or bylaw language  
- May not impose permanent discipline without later confirmation under normal procedures  

### Restrictions  
Governance Authority:
- Cannot be exercised unilaterally by an individual Board member  
- Cannot be exercised informally outside procedural requirements  
- Cannot be inferred from title, status, or physical presence  

Governance Authority exists only when procedurally activated.

---

## 2.1.3 Emergency Authority

### Definition  
Emergency Authority is a temporary and narrowly scoped authority allowing immediate protective action when delay would reasonably risk safety, property, or mission integrity.

### Scope  
Emergency Authority may:
- Issue interim protective measures  
- Restrict access temporarily  
- Stabilize immediate disruptions  

### Structural Constraints  
Emergency Authority:
- Must cite documented authority  
- Automatically triggers mandatory review in accordance with **Module 1 – Interim Review Failure Contingency**  
- Automatically expires within defined time limits if not affirmed  
- Cannot escalate or extend through inaction  
- Is protective and preventive, not punitive  

---

## 2.1.4 Interpretive Authority

### Definition  
Interpretive Authority is the limited authority to interpret ambiguous language within governing documents when explicit guidance is absent.

### Constraints  
Interpretations:
- Must be documented  
- Must cite the ambiguous provision  
- May not contradict explicit language  
- Do not create new authority  
- Remain subject to later clarification or amendment  

Silence does not equal permission unless the governing documents explicitly grant interpretive discretion.

---

## Structural Principle  

All authority within the Club is:
- Documented  
- Scoped  
- Reviewable  
- Temporary unless explicitly permanent  
- Subordinate to mission protection  

No authority expands through habit, precedent, or personality.

- - -

## 2.2 Doctrine of Express Authority and Interpretive Restraint

### Purpose  
This doctrine establishes that all governance authority must originate from explicit, documented sources. It prevents the creation of informal, implied, or personality-based authority and preserves the principle that authority flows from governing documents rather than individuals.

---

### 2.2.1 Principle of Explicit Grant  

All governance authority exercised within the Club must be grounded in an explicit provision of the bylaws, policies, or formally adopted governance framework. Powers not expressly granted are reserved and may not be assumed.

Silence in governing documents does not constitute permission.

---

### 2.2.2 Prohibition on Implied Authority  

No individual, officer, or Board may claim authority based on:
- Tradition or past informal practice  
- Personal status, reputation, or tenure  
- Organizational convenience  
- Urgency not meeting emergency authority standards  
- Interpretation that contradicts explicit language  

Custom, precedent, or repeated behavior does not create new authority.

---

### 2.2.3 Limited Interpretive Discretion  

When governing documents are ambiguous and no explicit guidance exists, the Board may exercise interpretive discretion only if:

- The ambiguity is documented  
- The specific provision in question is cited  
- The interpretation is formally recorded  
- The interpretation does not contradict explicit language  
- The interpretation is treated as provisional and subject to future clarification  

Interpretation may clarify authority but may not expand it.

---

### 2.2.4 Mission Supremacy Constraint  

No interpretation, procedural rule, or operational decision may be used to directly or indirectly modify or weaken the Club’s mission, sobriety requirements, inclusivity commitments, or nonprofit purpose.

Any decision with mission-modifying effect must be treated as a structural governance action and subject to the highest applicable thresholds.

---

### 2.2.5 Enforcement and Review  

Any member, officer, or governance body may challenge actions believed to violate the Doctrine of Express Authority. Such challenges shall be reviewed through the procedures established in Module 3 – Governance Failure and Enforcement.

---

### Structural Principle  

Authority must be:
- Explicit  
- Documented  
- Reviewable  
- Mission-aligned  

Where ambiguity exists, restraint is presumed.

All governance actions must comply with this doctrine before proceeding to formal decision.
