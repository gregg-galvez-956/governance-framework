# Module 2 – Governance Decision Validation Protocol

## 2.1 Authority Classification

### Purpose  
This section defines and structurally separates categories of authority within the Club to prevent role confusion, informal hierarchy, and unauthorized governance expansion. Authority is role-bound, documented, and limited. No authority expands through precedent, presence, habit, or personality.

---

## 2.1.1 Operational Authority

### Definition  
Operational Authority is the limited authority granted to individuals assigned to oversee the physical premises, meetings, and day-to-day functioning of the Club during designated hours.

### Scope  
Operational Authority may include:
- Maintaining order and safety on premises  
- Enforcing the Standards of Conduct  
- Issuing temporary protective actions as defined in Emergency Authority provisions  
- Managing facility access during assigned shifts  
- Preserving property and preventing immediate harm  

### Limitations  
Operational Authority may not:
- Amend policy  
- Modify mission language  
- Issue long-term bans  
- Create new rules  
- Override documented governance decisions  
- Exercise governance authority by presence, seniority, or perceived status  

Operational Authority is temporary, scoped, and role-bound.

---

## 2.1.2 Governance Authority

### Definition  
Governance Authority is the authority vested in the Board as a collective body to make binding decisions concerning policy, structure, discipline, and mission-related matters.

### Scope  
Governance Authority may only be exercised:
- Through properly noticed meetings  
- With quorum present (as defined in the bylaws)  
- By recorded vote  
- Under explicitly cited bylaw authority  

### Regular Meeting Notice  
Regular Board meetings must be noticed at least **seven (7) calendar days** in advance. Notice must be delivered through all officially designated communication channels maintained by the Board.

### Emergency Meetings  
Emergency Board meetings may be called with a minimum of **forty-eight (48) hours’ notice**.

Emergency meeting notice must:
- Clearly state the emergency issue  
- Explain why delay would materially risk safety, property, or mission integrity  

Emergency meetings:
- May address only the stated emergency matter  
- May not introduce unrelated business  
- May not amend mission or bylaw language  
- May not impose permanent discipline without later confirmation under normal procedures  

### Restrictions  
Governance Authority:
- Cannot be exercised unilaterally by an individual Board member  
- Cannot be exercised informally outside procedural requirements  
- Cannot be inferred from title, status, or physical presence  

Governance Authority exists only when procedurally activated.

---

## 2.1.3 Emergency Authority

### Definition  
Emergency Authority is a temporary and narrowly scoped authority allowing immediate protective action when delay would reasonably risk safety, property, or mission integrity.

### Scope  
Emergency Authority may:
- Issue interim protective measures  
- Restrict access temporarily  
- Stabilize immediate disruptions  

### Structural Constraints  
Emergency Authority:
- Must cite documented authority  
- Automatically triggers mandatory review in accordance with **Module 1 – Interim Review Failure Contingency**  
- Automatically expires within defined time limits if not affirmed  
- Cannot escalate or extend through inaction  
- Is protective and preventive, not punitive  

---

## 2.1.4 Interpretive Authority

### Definition  
Interpretive Authority is the limited authority to interpret ambiguous language within governing documents when explicit guidance is absent.

### Constraints  
Interpretations:
- Must be documented  
- Must cite the ambiguous provision  
- May not contradict explicit language  
- Do not create new authority  
- Remain subject to later clarification or amendment  

Silence does not equal permission unless the governing documents explicitly grant interpretive discretion.

---

## Structural Principle  

All authority within the Club is:
- Documented  
- Scoped  
- Reviewable  
- Temporary unless explicitly permanent  
- Subordinate to mission protection  

No authority expands through habit, precedent, or personality.

- - -

## 2.2 Doctrine of Express Authority and Interpretive Restraint

### Purpose  
This doctrine establishes that all governance authority must originate from explicit, documented sources. It prevents the creation of informal, implied, or personality-based authority and preserves the principle that authority flows from governing documents rather than individuals.

---

### 2.2.1 Principle of Explicit Grant  

All governance authority exercised within the Club must be grounded in an explicit provision of the bylaws, policies, or formally adopted governance framework. Powers not expressly granted are reserved and may not be assumed.

Silence in governing documents does not constitute permission.

---

### 2.2.2 Prohibition on Implied Authority  

No individual, officer, or Board may claim authority based on:
- Tradition or past informal practice  
- Personal status, reputation, or tenure  
- Organizational convenience  
- Urgency not meeting emergency authority standards  
- Interpretation that contradicts explicit language  

Custom, precedent, or repeated behavior does not create new authority.

---

### 2.2.3 Limited Interpretive Discretion  

When governing documents are ambiguous and no explicit guidance exists, the Board may exercise interpretive discretion only if:

- The ambiguity is documented  
- The specific provision in question is cited  
- The interpretation is formally recorded  
- The interpretation does not contradict explicit language  
- The interpretation is treated as provisional and subject to future clarification  

Interpretation may clarify authority but may not expand it.

---

### 2.2.4 Mission Supremacy Constraint  

No interpretation, procedural rule, or operational decision may be used to directly or indirectly modify or weaken the Club’s mission, sobriety requirements, inclusivity commitments, or nonprofit purpose.

Any decision with mission-modifying effect must be treated as a structural governance action and subject to the highest applicable thresholds.

---

### 2.2.5 Enforcement and Review  

Any member, officer, or governance body may challenge actions believed to violate the Doctrine of Express Authority. Such challenges shall be reviewed through the procedures established in Module 3 – Governance Failure and Enforcement.

---

### Structural Principle  

Authority must be:
- Explicit  
- Documented  
- Reviewable  
- Mission-aligned  

Where ambiguity exists, restraint is presumed.

All governance actions must comply with this doctrine before proceeding to formal decision.


## 2.3 Pre-Vote Legitimacy Requirements

### Purpose  
This section establishes procedural safeguards that must be satisfied before any governance vote becomes valid. These requirements ensure transparency, consistency, and accountability while preventing informal or procedurally defective decision-making.

Failure to meet these requirements renders the resulting decision procedurally invalid and subject to challenge.

---

### 2.3.1 Authority Citation Requirement  

Before any governance vote, the presiding officer or designated facilitator must identify and record:

- The specific bylaw, policy, or governance framework provision authorizing the proposed action  
- Whether the authority is explicit or interpretive  
- The category of authority being exercised (Operational, Governance, Emergency, or Interpretive)

No vote may proceed without documented authority.

---

### 2.3.2 Mission Impact Classification  

Prior to deliberation, the proposed action must be classified as one of the following:

- Mission-preserving  
- Mission-neutral  
- Mission-adjacent  
- Mission-modifying  

If an action is classified as mission-modifying, the highest applicable thresholds for quorum, notice, and voting must automatically apply.

Mission classification must be recorded in the meeting record.

---

### 2.3.3 Threshold and Quorum Confirmation  

Before any vote, the Board must:

- Confirm quorum in accordance with the bylaws  
- Declare the required vote threshold  
- Record the quorum and threshold in meeting minutes  

No decision may be finalized without verified quorum.

---

### 2.3.4 Conflict of Interest Disclosure  

Prior to deliberation, Board members must disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest related to the matter under consideration.

Conflicted members must:

- Recuse themselves from voting  
- Have their recusal recorded in meeting minutes  

Failure to disclose material conflicts may invalidate the decision and trigger review.

---

### 2.3.5 Scope and Agenda Integrity  

No governance vote may occur unless the matter was:

- Properly noticed  
- Included in the meeting agenda  
- Within the scope of the meeting type (regular or emergency)

Emergency meetings may not introduce unrelated governance actions.

---

### 2.3.6 Documentation and Recordkeeping  

For each governance vote, the following must be documented:

- Motion language  
- Authority citation  
- Mission classification  
- Quorum verification  
- Vote tally  
- Conflict disclosures  
- Final determination  

Records must be preserved in accordance with governance recordkeeping policies.

---

### 2.3.7 Appeal and Review Notice  

Upon completion of a vote, the Board must identify:

- Whether the decision is subject to appeal  
- The procedure for appeal  
- The timeline for appeal  

Failure to communicate review rights may extend the appeal window.

---

### Structural Principle  

A decision is legitimate only if:

- Authority is explicit  
- Process is transparent  
- Mission impact is evaluated  
- Conflicts are disclosed  
- Records are preserved  

Procedural integrity is a safeguard against both abuse and error.

- - - 

## 2.4 Decision Documentation and Publication Standards

### Purpose  
This section ensures that all governance decisions are documented, accessible, and reviewable. It prevents hidden decision-making, selective memory, and informal reinterpretation of prior actions. Transparency and record integrity are essential for institutional continuity and legitimacy.

---

### 2.4.1 Official Record Requirement  

All governance actions must be recorded in an official and permanent governance record. No decision is considered final until it is documented in accordance with this section.

The official record must be maintained in a secure and accessible format determined by governance policy.

---

### 2.4.2 Minimum Documentation Standards  

For each governance decision, the record must include:

- Date and time of the meeting  
- Meeting type (regular or emergency)  
- Notice compliance  
- Authority citation  
- Mission classification  
- Motion language  
- Quorum confirmation  
- Conflict disclosures  
- Vote tally  
- Final determination  
- Identified appeal or review pathway  

Incomplete records may invalidate the decision.

---

### 2.4.3 Publication and Accessibility  

Governance decisions must be made reasonably accessible to members in good standing. Accessibility methods may include:

- Member-accessible digital archive  
- Physical record availability at the Club  
- Summary communication through official channels  

Operational details may remain confidential when necessary to protect privacy, safety, or legal compliance.

---

### 2.4.4 Confidentiality and Safety Constraints  

Certain information may be restricted when disclosure would:

- Violate privacy  
- Compromise safety  
- Interfere with recovery or peer support  
- Create legal or reputational harm  

In such cases, the existence of the decision must still be recorded, even if specific details are limited.

---

### 2.4.5 Record Preservation  

Governance records must be preserved in accordance with retention standards defined in governance policy. Records may not be altered or removed without formal authorization.

Historical records must remain available for pattern analysis, institutional learning, and accountability.

---

### 2.4.6 Correction and Clarification  

If documentation errors are discovered:

- Corrections must be recorded transparently  
- Original records must remain intact  
- Clarifications may not change the substance of prior decisions without formal reconsideration  

---

### Structural Principle  

Transparency protects legitimacy.  
Documentation preserves institutional memory.  
No governance authority exists outside the record.

- - -

## 2.5 Mission Impact and Structural Threshold Triggers

### Purpose  
This section establishes objective triggers for heightened governance safeguards when proposed actions materially affect the Club’s mission, identity, structure, or long-term integrity. It prevents incremental mission drift and ensures that foundational commitments cannot be altered through procedural or interpretive shortcuts.

---

### 2.5.1 Mission Protection Framework  

The Club’s mission, sobriety commitment, inclusivity principles, and nonprofit purpose are foundational and receive the highest level of governance protection.

Any action that directly or indirectly alters these foundations must be treated as a structural governance decision and subject to elevated safeguards.

---

### 2.5.2 Automatic Structural Classification  

The following categories of action are automatically classified as structural:

- Modification of mission or purpose  
- Changes to sobriety expectations or requirements  
- Alteration of inclusivity or nondiscrimination commitments  
- Changes affecting populations served or community focus  
- Structural changes to governance authority or decision-making processes  
- Changes to enforcement mechanisms, appeal rights, or member standing  
- Amendment of quorum, voting thresholds, or procedural safeguards  
- Creation, restructuring, or elimination of governance bodies  
- Dissolution, merger, or major organizational restructuring  

Classification is based on material impact, not framing or terminology. No procedural or interpretive mechanism may be used to avoid structural classification.

---

### 2.5.3 Elevated Safeguards  

Structural decisions must meet:

- Highest applicable quorum requirements as defined in the bylaws  
- Extended notice and deliberation periods  
- Supermajority voting thresholds  
- Documentation of rationale and anticipated impact  

Emergency Authority may not be used to enact, bypass, or indirectly implement structural decisions.

---

### 2.5.4 Pattern and Drift Detection  

If repeated operational or emergency actions cumulatively produce structural effects, the Board must initiate formal structural review.

Indicators include:

- Repeated temporary measures addressing the same issue  
- Informal policy enforcement without formal adoption  
- Gradual reinterpretation of mission language  
- Habit-based governance replacing formal procedure  

Upon detection, the Board must:

- Pause related actions  
- Conduct formal review  
- Document findings, risks, and proposed corrective pathways  

---

### 2.5.5 Safeguard Against Incremental Change  

No sequence of minor, technical, or operational adjustments may be used to accomplish a major change that would otherwise require elevated safeguards.

Material long-term impact governs classification, not the size of individual decisions.

---

### 2.5.6 Institutional Legitimacy Consideration  

For structural decisions, the Board must consider and document:

- Long-term mission alignment  
- Community trust and credibility  
- Organizational stability and continuity  
- Impact on recovery safety and inclusion  

---

### Structural Principle  

Mission protection requires active vigilance. Structural safeguards activate automatically when core identity is at risk.

- - -

## 2.6 Emergency Authority Containment and Review Integration

### Purpose  
This section integrates Emergency Authority with ongoing governance legitimacy requirements. It ensures that temporary protective actions remain limited, reviewable, and subordinate to formal governance processes. It prevents normalization of emergency authority and protects against drift toward informal or authoritarian decision-making.

---

### 2.6.1 Temporary Nature of Emergency Authority  

Emergency Authority exists solely to stabilize immediate risk. It is temporary by design and does not create standing governance authority.

No emergency action may establish precedent, policy, or ongoing governance practice without formal review and ratification.

---

### 2.6.2 Mandatory Review Trigger  

All emergency actions automatically trigger a required Board review in accordance with **Module 1 – Interim Review Failure Contingency**.

This review must:

- Occur within the defined review period  
- Evaluate necessity, proportionality, and mission alignment  
- Determine whether the action should be affirmed, modified, or allowed to expire  

Failure to conduct timely review results in automatic expiration of the emergency action.

---

### 2.6.3 Prohibition on Escalation Through Inaction  

Emergency Authority may not expand, extend, or escalate through:

- Delay in scheduling review  
- Repeated temporary extensions  
- Informal continuation of restrictions  
- Passive or intentional inaction  

Inaction does not confer authority.

---

### 2.6.4 Conversion to Formal Governance  

If an emergency action reveals a recurring or structural issue, the Board must:

- Initiate formal governance deliberation  
- Classify the issue under Section 2.5  
- Apply appropriate structural safeguards  

Emergency measures must transition to formal governance or terminate.

---

### 2.6.5 Pattern Monitoring  

Repeated reliance on emergency authority for similar situations requires:

- Documentation of pattern  
- Risk assessment  
- Evaluation of systemic causes  
- Formal policy or structural response  

This prevents normalization of crisis-driven governance.

---

### 2.6.6 Documentation and Transparency  

All emergency actions and subsequent reviews must be documented in accordance with Section 2.4.

Records must include:

- Nature of the emergency  
- Authority invoked  
- Actions taken  
- Duration  
- Review outcome  

---

### Structural Principle  

Emergency Authority protects safety in moments of instability.  
Formal governance protects legitimacy in the long term.  
Temporary power must never become permanent.
