# Module: Interim Review Failure Contingency

## Purpose

This module defines the procedural response when a required Board review of an interim protective action does not occur within the mandated time frame. It prevents indefinite restriction by inaction while preserving safety, documented authority, and governance legitimacy.

## Trigger Condition

- An interim protective action has been initiated under documented authority.
- A Board review is required within a defined period (e.g., 1 calendar day).
- The required Board review does not occur within that period.

## Governing Principles Applied

- Authority flows from written governing documents.
- Discipline serves safety and mission preservation, not punishment.
- No restriction continues solely due to Board inaction.
- Decisions must be documented, reviewable, and consistently applied.

## Procedural Rule

If the required Board review does not occur within the mandated review period, interim protective actions may continue only for a strictly limited, predefined grace period.

If the Board review still does not occur by the end of that grace period:

- The interim protective action automatically expires.
- No restriction may continue without a new, procedurally valid determination.
- The underlying incident record remains intact and reviewable.

## Record Retention

Expiration of interim action does not erase:

- Incident documentation
- Prior findings
- Recorded materials
- Meeting notes or evidence

Facts persist. Temporary authority does not.

## Prohibited Outcomes

The following are not permitted:

- Silent continuation of interim restrictions due to Board inaction
- Automatic escalation based solely on prior appearance
- Informal extension of authority without quorum-based review
- Creation of new authority through neglect

## Governance Risk Mitigated

This module prevents:

- Indefinite restriction by inertia
- De facto emergency authority expansion
- Punitive effect through procedural failure
- Authoritarian drift via pattern accumulation

## Relationship to Other Modules

This module operates in coordination with:

- Emergency Authority Module
- Discipline Gradient Module
- Board Review and Appeals Module
