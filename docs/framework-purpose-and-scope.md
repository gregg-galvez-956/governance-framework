# Framework Purpose and Scope

## Purpose
This governance framework exists to define the boundaries, constraints, and design expectations for governance artifacts created within this repository. It serves as a reference point against which all subsequent work is evaluated.

## Context
This document is intentionally created first. Establishing purpose and constraints early reduces ambiguity, prevents scope drift, and supports consistency across all future governance artifacts.

## In Scope
- Definition of the framework’s purpose and intended use
- Principles that constrain governance design and decision-making
- Documentation of how design decisions are evaluated against those principles
- High-level references that clarify intended application without full implementation

## Out of Scope
- Legal advice or statutory interpretation
- Fundraising, finance, or operational management
- Human resources policies beyond governance authority
- Full implementation of bylaws or organizational documents

## Constraints
- Authority flows from written governing documents rather than individuals or roles
- Discipline is framed as safety and mission preservation, not punishment
- Processes must be documented, reviewable, and consistently applied
- Access to the organization’s core purpose is not arbitrarily restricted, except under clearly defined emergency conditions
