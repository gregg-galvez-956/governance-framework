## 2.1 Authority Classification

### Purpose  
This section defines and structurally separates categories of authority within the Club to prevent role confusion, informal hierarchy, and unauthorized governance expansion. Authority is role-bound, documented, and limited. No authority expands through precedent, presence, habit, or personality.

## 2.1.2 Governance Authority

### Definition  
Governance Authority is the authority vested in the Board as a collective body to make binding decisions concerning policy, structure, discipline, and mission-related matters.

### Scope  
Governance Authority may only be exercised:
- Through properly noticed meetings  
- With quorum present (as defined in the bylaws)  
- By recorded vote  
- Under explicitly cited bylaw authority  

### Regular Meeting Notice  
Regular Board meetings must be noticed at least **seven (7) calendar days** in advance. Notice must be delivered through all officially designated communication channels maintained by the Board.

### Emergency Meetings  
Emergency Board meetings may be called with a minimum of **forty-eight (48) hours’ notice**.

Emergency meeting notice must:
- Clearly state the emergency issue  
- Explain why delay would materially risk safety, property, or mission integrity  

Emergency meetings:
- May address only the stated emergency matter  
- May not introduce unrelated business  
- May not amend mission or bylaw language  
- May not impose permanent discipline without later confirmation under normal procedures  

### Restrictions  
Governance Authority:
- Cannot be exercised unilaterally by an individual Board member  
- Cannot be exercised informally outside procedural requirements  
- Cannot be inferred from title, status, or physical presence  

Governance Authority exists only when procedurally activated.

## 2.1.3 Emergency Authority

### Definition  
Emergency Authority is a temporary and narrowly scoped authority allowing immediate protective action when delay would reasonably risk safety, property, or mission integrity.

### Scope  
Emergency Authority may:
- Issue interim protective measures  
- Restrict access temporarily  
- Stabilize immediate disruptions  

### Structural Constraints  
Emergency Authority:
- Must cite documented authority  
- Automatically triggers mandatory review in accordance with **Module 1 – Interim Review Failure Contingency**  
- Automatically expires within defined time limits if not affirmed  
- Cannot escalate or extend through inaction  
- Is protective and preventive, not punitive  

---

## 2.1.4 Interpretive Authority

### Definition  
Interpretive Authority is the limited authority to interpret ambiguous language within governing documents when explicit guidance is absent.

### Constraints  
Interpretations:
- Must be documented  
- Must cite the ambiguous provision  
- May not contradict explicit language  
- Do not create new authority  
- Remain subject to later clarification or amendment  

Silence does not equal permission unless the governing documents explicitly grant interpretive discretion.

---

## Structural Principle  

All authority within the Club is:
- Documented  
- Scoped  
- Reviewable  
- Temporary unless explicitly permanent  
- Subordinate to mission protection  

No authority expands through habit, precedent, or personality.
