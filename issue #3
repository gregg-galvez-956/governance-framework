# Scenario: Discipline Without Exclusion

## Context
The organization maintains a shared space aligned with its core mission. A participant engages in repeated behavior that disrupts the environment or causes harm to others, but the behavior does not rise to a level that clearly justifies removal or suspension under the governing documents. The organization’s purpose emphasizes access, inclusion, and safety, creating tension between intervention and exclusion.

## Actors
- Governing board or authority defined by written documents  
- Designated officers or committees responsible for conduct and safety  
- A participant whose conduct is at issue  
- Other participants affected by the behavior  

## Constraints
- Discipline is framed as safety and mission preservation, not punishment  
- Access to the organization’s core purpose should not be arbitrarily restricted  
- Authority must be exercised within documented limits  
- Actions and decisions must be documented, reviewable, and consistently applied  

## Decision Pressure
The organization must determine whether intervention is required and what forms of discipline are permissible without excluding the participant from the organization’s core purpose. Inaction risks continued harm or erosion of trust, while exclusion risks violating access principles and mission commitments. Ambiguity exists around proportional response, consistency with past actions, and how corrective measures are defined when removal is not an option.

## Out of Scope
This scenario does not assign fault, prescribe disciplinary outcomes, or define enforcement mechanisms. Legal liability, employment considerations, and statutory compliance are explicitly excluded.
