# Scenario: Emergency Authority and Review

## Context
A situation presents an immediate and credible threat to safety, order, or mission integrity within the organization’s shared space. Under the governing documents, a specific role is vested with limited emergency authority to take temporary action when delay would increase risk. Intervention occurs before the governing board can convene, and the action is visible to participants.

## Actors
- The individual vested with emergency authority under the governing documents  
- The governing board responsible for post-action review  
- A participant or participants directly affected by the emergency action  
- Other individuals present or indirectly impacted  

## Constraints
- Emergency authority is limited in scope and duration as defined by written governing documents  
- Actions taken under emergency authority must be documented at the time of intervention  
- Emergency measures do not permanently alter governance authority or structure  
- A timely and substantive board review is required following emergency action  

## Decision Pressure
The individual vested with emergency authority must determine whether the documented threshold for emergency intervention has been met and what temporary measures fall within defined limits. Delay may increase harm, while overreach risks exceeding authority. Following intervention, the governing board must evaluate whether the action complied with documented constraints, remained proportional to the threat, and preserved governance legitimacy in both structure and perception.

## Out of Scope
- Determination of whether the emergency threshold was ultimately satisfied  
- Prescription of corrective or disciplinary outcomes  
- Criminal liability, statutory compliance, or regulatory interpretation  
- External enforcement mechanisms  
- Assessments beyond documented governance authority and required review processes
