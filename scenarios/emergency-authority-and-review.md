# Scenario: Emergency Authority and Post-Action Review

## Context
A situation arises that presents an immediate and credible threat to safety, order, or mission integrity within the organization’s shared space. The ward, as defined by governing documents, holds limited emergency authority to take temporary action when delay would increase risk. Immediate intervention occurs before the governing board can convene.

## Actors
- The ward exercising defined emergency authority  
- The governing board responsible for post-action review  
- A participant or participants directly affected by the emergency action  
- Other individuals present or impacted by the situation  

## Constraints
- Emergency authority is limited in scope and duration as defined by written governing documents  
- Actions taken under emergency authority must be documented  
- Emergency measures do not permanently alter governance structure or authority  
- A timely board review is required following emergency action  

## Decision Pressure
The ward must determine whether the situation meets the threshold for emergency authority and what temporary measures are permissible within documented limits. Delay may increase harm, while overreach risks exceeding defined authority. Following the intervention, the governing board must assess whether the action was justified, proportional, and consistent with governing constraints, and whether remediation or clarification is required.

## Out of Scope
This scenario does not determine whether the emergency threshold was met, prescribe corrective outcomes, or define disciplinary consequences. It does not address criminal liability, statutory compliance, or external enforcement actions.
