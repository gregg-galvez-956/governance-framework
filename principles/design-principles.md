## Core Design Principles

# 1. Authority Is Document-Bound

All governance authority must originate from written governing documents. No decision, role, or action is considered authoritative unless it can be traced back to an explicit, documented source.

# 2. Constraints Precede Discretion

Boundaries and limits are defined before judgment is exercised. Governance design prioritizes clear constraints so that discretion is applied within known limits rather than invented in the moment.

# 3. Discipline Serves Safety and Mission Preservation

Corrective actions are framed as mechanisms to protect safety, access, and mission continuity, not as punishment. Governance artifacts must reflect this framing explicitly.

# 4. Decisions Must Be Traceable and Reviewable

Governance processes are designed so that decisions can be reviewed after the fact. Documentation is not optional; it is a core requirement for legitimacy and consistency.

# 5. Consistency Overrides Convenience

Short-term ease does not justify deviation from documented processes. Governance artifacts favor repeatability and clarity over expedient exceptions.

# 6. Access Is the Default, Restriction Is Exceptional

Participation in the organization’s core purpose should not be arbitrarily restricted. Any restriction must be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and justified by documented conditions, including emergency circumstances.

# 7. Interpretation Is Constrained by Intent

Governance artifacts are interpreted in alignment with their documented purpose and constraints. Interpretive flexibility does not extend to outcomes that undermine mission, safety, or structural integrity.
