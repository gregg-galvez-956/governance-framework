Issue #2 — Define-Core-Design-Principles.md

## Goal

Produce a concise set of design principles that constrain how governance artifacts in this repository are created, evaluated, revised, and interpreted.

## Context

With the framework purpose and scope established, design principles are required to define how governance decisions are judged and constrained. These principles provide a consistent evaluative lens across artifacts, preventing ad-hoc reasoning and outcome-driven interpretation.

## In Scope

Definition of core principles that apply across all governance artifacts
Constraints that guide how authority, access, and discipline are structured
Principles that support consistency, traceability, and reviewability

## Out of Scope

Scenario-specific rules or examples
Policy implementation or procedural detail
Legal interpretation or statutory guidance
Constraints
Principles must be general enough to apply across multiple contexts
Principles must be actionable and reviewable, not aspirational
Principles must prioritize documented authority over informal practice

## Definition of Done

A design principles document exists at /principles/design-principles.md
Principles are referenced in the repository README
Principles are sufficient to evaluate future artifacts without additional context
