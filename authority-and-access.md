# Scenario: Role vs. Document Authority

## Context
An organization assigns formal titles and operational roles to support its day-to-day functioning. Separately, written governing documents define where governance authority resides. A situation arises in which an individual acting under a recognized role asserts decision-making authority that is not clearly supported by the governing documents.

## Actors
- An individual holding an operational or leadership role  
- The governing body or authority defined by written documents  
- Participants affected by the asserted decision  

## Constraints
- Governance authority originates from written governing documents, not titles or informal practice  
- Roles exist to support execution and coordination, not to independently create authority  
- Decisions must be traceable to explicit, documented sources  

## Decision Pressure
The organization must assess whether the action taken under role authority is valid, exceeds documented limits, or establishes an unintended precedent. Tension exists between operational continuity, customary practice, and adherence to the constraints imposed by governing documents.

## Out of Scope
This scenario does not assess intent or performance, prescribe corrective actions, or address employment, compensation, or legal liability.
