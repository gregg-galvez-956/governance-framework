## Context
An organization operates a shared space dedicated to its core mission. The space is governed by written bylaws and supporting governance documents that define authority, access, and conduct expectations.
A conflict arises involving a participant whose behavior is alleged to undermine safety or mission integrity, but whose access to the space is otherwise protected by the organization’s stated purpose.

## Actors
- Governing board or equivalent authority body

- Designated officers or committee members

- A participant or member whose conduct is in question

- Other participants affected by the situation  

## Constraints
- Authority must be exercised in accordance with written governing documents

- Discipline is framed as safety and mission preservation, not punishment

- Access to the organization’s core purpose should not be arbitrarily restricted

- Decisions must be documented and reviewable  

## Decision Pressure
The governing body must determine whether and how to intervene in the situation. Competing pressures include maintaining safety, preserving access to the organization’s mission, adhering to documented authority limits, and responding to concerns raised by other participants.
Ambiguity exists regarding which governing documents apply, who holds decision authority in the moment, and what actions are permissible without constituting arbitrary restriction.

## Out of Scope
This scenario does not prescribe a resolution, determine fault, or define disciplinary outcomes.

It does not address legal liability, employment status, or enforcement mechanisms beyond governance authority.
