# Scenario: Access Under Conflict

## Context
The organization operates a shared space in service of its core mission. Governance authority, access, and conduct expectations are defined by written governing documents. A conflict arises involving a participant whose behavior is alleged to compromise safety or mission integrity while their access to the space remains protected under the organization’s stated purpose.

## Actors
- Governing board or equivalent decision-making body  
- Officers or committees authorized by governing documents  
- A participant whose conduct is in question  
- Other participants affected by the situation  

## Constraints
- Authority may only be exercised as defined in written governing documents  
- Disciplinary action is framed as safety and mission preservation, not punishment  
- Access to the organization’s core purpose is not to be arbitrarily restricted  
- Decisions must be documented, reviewable, and consistently applied  

## Decision Pressure
The governing body must determine whether intervention is required and, if so, what actions fall within its documented authority. Tension exists between preserving safety, maintaining access, responding to participant concerns, and avoiding arbitrary restriction. Ambiguity arises around which governing provisions apply, who holds decision authority in the moment, and what actions are permissible without exceeding defined limits.

## Out of Scope
This scenario does not determine fault, prescribe outcomes, or define enforcement mechanisms. Legal liability, employment status, and statutory compliance are explicitly excluded.
