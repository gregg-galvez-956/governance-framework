scenarios/discipline-without-exclusion.md

## Context
The organization maintains a shared space aligned with its core mission. A participant engages in repeated conduct that disrupts the environment, raises safety concerns, or undermines trust among other participants. The behavior does not rise to the level that clearly justifies removal or suspension under governing documents, and exclusion would conflict with the organization’s stated commitment to access.

## Actors
- Governing board or designated governance authority  
- Officers, ward, or committees responsible for maintaining safety and order  
- A participant whose conduct is under review  
- Other participants affected by the conduct  

## Constraints
- Disciplinary action is framed as safety and mission preservation, not punishment  
- Access to the organization’s core purpose should not be arbitrarily restricted  
- Authority to intervene must be grounded in written governing documents  
- Processes must be documented, reviewable, and consistently applied  

## Decision Pressure
The organization must determine whether and how to intervene when exclusion is neither clearly justified nor clearly avoidable. Inaction risks normalizing harmful behavior and eroding trust. Intervention risks being perceived as arbitrary, punitive, or inconsistent. Ambiguity exists around what corrective actions are permissible, how they are communicated, and how consistency is maintained across similar cases.

## Out of Scope
This scenario does not define disciplinary outcomes, prescribe corrective measures, or determine fault. Legal considerations, enforcement mechanisms, and employment or membership status are excluded.
