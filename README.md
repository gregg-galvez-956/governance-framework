# Governance Framework

Sample non-profit governance framework with documented decision logic, structural constraints, and scenario-based stress tests.

---

## Purpose

The purpose, scope, and non-negotiable constraints of this governance framework are defined in:

- [`/docs/framework-purpose-and-scope.md`](docs/framework-purpose-and-scope.md)

This document establishes the boundaries within which all governance artifacts in this repository are created and evaluated.

---

## Design Principles

Core governance design principles are defined in:

- [`/principles/design-principles.md`](principles/design-principles.md)

All governance artifacts are evaluated against these principles to ensure consistency, traceability, and document-bound authority.

---

## Governance Scenarios

Representative governance stress-test scenarios are documented in:

- [`/scenarios`](scenarios)

These scenarios provide structured inputs used to test authority limits, access protections, disciplinary structure, emergency authority, and post-action review obligations.

## How to Read / Review

1. Start with **Framework Purpose & Scope** to understand structural boundaries.  
2. Review **Design Principles** to understand evaluative constraints.  
3. Examine the **Scenarios** to see how governance pressure points are modeled.  

Artifacts in this repository are sequenced intentionally and should be reviewed in that order.
